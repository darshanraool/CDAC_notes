> Hbase has the dependency of hadoop and zookeeper.

> Creating table:
	# create 'notification','attributes','metrics'
		where, notification = table name
				attributes , metrics = column family (group of columns which are symmentically related).> Column cannot exists without column family.

> Columns are created during the insertion of data.

> Every table must have 1 column family.

> RowID must be unique.

> When table is created in HBase, it automatically gets uploaded on HDFS.

> On HDFS, folders are made of the name of Column Families in columer file format(binary format). The file where data is stored is called as HFile.
