> Store the data together on which data operations are performed together.

> Cannot perform JOIN and GROUP operations.

> Hbase has the dependency of hadoop and zookeeper.

> Creating table:
	# create 'notification','attributes','metrics'.
		- where, notification = table name
				attributes , metrics = column family (group of columns which are symmentically related).> Column cannot exists without column family.

> Columns are created during the insertion of data.

> Every table must have 1 column family.

> RowID must be unique.

> When table is created in HBase, it automatically gets uploaded on HDFS.

> On HDFS, folders are made of the name of Column Families in columnar file format(binary format). The file where data is stored is called as HFile.

> Regions:
	- HBase table is divided into horizontal partitioning known as Regions.

> RegionServers: 
	- These Regions reside on various different DataNode known as RegionServers.

> Creating and deleting the table (DDL operations) are handled by HMaster process.

> Zookeeper maintains the state of servers i.e. which servers are alive and available to serve the request and send notification in case of failure.

> Ephurmal node is in memory. It will start a session of DataNode in zookeeper which will represent the state of the DataNode.

> Meta Table holds the info. about the regions.

> View table in zookeeper:
	# ls /hbase/table: 

> Delete the table from zookeeper.
	# rmr /hbasse/table/<table_name>: Run this command and restart hbase services.

> RegionServers components:
	- WAL: Used to store new data that is not in permanent storage. Used to recover in case of failure. Used for crash recovery of the data.
	- BlockCache: Read the frequently accessed the data in the memory.
	- MemStore: Stores the new Data which is not written on the disk. 1 MemStore for 1 ColumnFamily.
	- 
	
> Minor Compaction:
	- HBase picks up smaller HFile and writes it in bigger HFile. It is called as Minor Compaction.
	
> Major Compaction:
	- Merges and rewrites all HFiles in a region to one HFile per column family.
