> Boosting is more time consuming than RandomForest, because in RandomForest the boostraping is executed parallely, but in Boosting, the 
boostraping is fone only after the 1 boosting is over.


> Stacking: Apply more than 2 algorithms on dataset and form a dataset of values obtained by prediction of algorithms. Apply another algorithm(Final estimators) and predict
final values of the dataset.

> Time series components:
	1. Trend: Long term increase or decrese of in data.
	2. Seasonal: Contains pattern with regular interval.
	3. Cyclic: 
	4. Random:
