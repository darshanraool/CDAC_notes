> HIVE: 
	- It is a data warehouse for Hadoop. 
	- It points to heterogenous form of data residing on HDFS and retrives it in the form of schema. 
	- It is a folder residing on HDFS.
	- The data stored in HIVE is in unstructured format, but if user want to see the data, it is visible in tabular format.
	- Uses HiveQL as scripting language.

# ROW FORMAT DELIMITED works on on Text(.txt) file.

> Types of tables: 
	- Managed: Data & Metadata both are deleted while dropping the table.
	- External: Only Data gets deleted and Metadata remains as it is.
	
# LOCATION: stores the file in the specified location.

> Metadata(Structure of the table like datatype of each field, database owner, location, etc.) is stored in MetastoreDB.
# describe formatted <table_name>: Use to display metadata of the table.


> Dynamic Partition: Used to distributed the data on the basis of a column which will act as a key.
	eg. suppose we partitioned a table by COUNTRY column, HIVE will extract unique values in the country column and it will group the records based in countries and stores it the seperate files.
		# create table dynamic_table(id string,name string) partitioned by (country string) row format delimited fields terminated by '\t';
		- /user/hive/warehouse/dynamic_table/country=India
		- /user/hive/warehouse/dynamic_table/country=US
		- /user/hive/warehouse/dynamic_table/country=UK
		
# distributed by :
	- Records with the specified field will be sent in the table using a single reducer.
	eg. No.	Age	Name
		1	10	abc
		2	15	aaa
		3	25	bbb
		4	15	ccc
		5	25	ddd
	- Persons with age 15 and 25 with be sent with each reducers respectively. (1 for 15 and 1 for 25)
